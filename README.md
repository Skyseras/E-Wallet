# E-Wallet
E-Wallet is more than a bank, it's a platform that reimagines financial services for a globalized world, throwing old-fashioned banks and clunky software out the window.

Today, the company wants to migrate its own monolithic system in charge of monetary operations to a microservices architecture.

## You are led to build the following different microservices:

### 1: the microservice that will be responsible for single sign-on (SSO), access control, rate limiting, resilience, security.

### 2: the body responsible for administering the wallets

### 3: the system capable of managing operations and transactions.

Think about your personal banking transactions, if for example you want to withdraw a substantial sum from your bank account in cash, you will quickly realize that it is one that can be accepted or refused... Another example, when you want to pay with your wallet, there is a whole validation procedure that the card corresponds to your bank account, that there are sufficient funds available, etc.
